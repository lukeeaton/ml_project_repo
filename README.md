# MSc Machine Learning Project & Improved version
Repository for the assignment completed during the Machine Learning module of my Neuroscience MSc, as well as an improved version which I completed in my own time the year after to develop and practise data analysis skills. Improvements were based on self-led study, including Kaggle online courses.
Improvements include:
- Using Pandas for data inspection, cleaning, exploration, etc., rather than simply manipulating Numpy arrays.
- Neater data visualisation using Seaborn.
- Preprocessor implementation.
- Implementing more models.
- Neural network creation using Keras.
- Example of feature engineering.
